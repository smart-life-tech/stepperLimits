Creating a README file for a GitHub repository is a great way to provide information about the project, how to set it up, and how to use it. Here's a basic template for a README file that you can use and customize for your Arduino project:

```markdown

## Introduction

Explain briefly what the project does and what problem it solves. Provide any context or background information necessary to understand the purpose of the project.

## Hardware

Describe the hardware components used in the project and their connections. Include a schematic or diagram if possible.

- Stepper motor
- ULN2003 motor driver
- Limit switches
- Other components...

## Software

List the software dependencies and any libraries used in the project.

- Arduino IDE
- Stepper library

## Setup

Provide step-by-step instructions on how to set up the hardware and software to run the project.

1. Connect the stepper motor to the ULN2003 motor driver.
2. Connect the limit switches to the Arduino.(1 pin to gnd the other to the arduino pin 2 and also 3 for the second)
3. Install the Arduino IDE and required libraries.
4. Upload the Arduino code to the board.

## Usage

Explain how to use the project and any specific features or functionalities it offers.

1. Power on the Arduino.
2. The motor will start spinning until it hits the first limit switch.
3. The motor will then reverse its direction and spin until it hits the second limit switch.
4. The process will repeat indefinitely.
